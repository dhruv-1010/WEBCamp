<!-- Project Looks absolutely gold 
just need some more CSS pictures icons and images and i would come out to be the best of my so far 
maybe I should invest more time on my creativity because sometimes 
things like this happens out of nowhere Best so far can be made better -->

        <h3>Margaret Hamilton timeline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="year">1936</p> - Born August 17 in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther
                Heafield (n√©e Partington).
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1954</p> - Graduates from Hancock High School.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1955</p> - Studies mathematics at the University of Michigan.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1958</p> - Earns a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from Earlham College.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1959</p> - Begins working for Professor Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology
                department at MIT. She programs on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC,
                developing software for weather prediction. This work leads to Lorenz's publications on chaos theory.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1961</p> - Moves on to another project in the summer and hires and trains Ellen Fetter
                as her replacement.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1961 - 1963</p> - Works on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at
                Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer
                (the XD-1) to search for unfriendly aircraft. She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project
                at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1964 - 1975</p> - It was her efforts on the SAGE project that made her a candidate for
                the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software. She joined the Charles Stark
                Draper Laboratory at MIT, which at the time was working on the Apollo space mission. She eventually led
                a team credited with developing the software for Apollo and Skylab. Her team was responsible for
                developing in-flight software, which included algorithms designed by various senior scientists for the
                Apollo command module, lunar lander and the subsequent Skylab. Another part of her team designed and
                developed the systems software. This included error detection and recovery software such as restarts and
                the Display Interface Routines (also known as the Priority Displays), which Hamilton designed and
                developed. Hamilton also served as Director of the Software Engineering Division.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1976 - 1984</p> - CEO and co-founder of Higher Order Software (HOS) to further develop
                ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from her experience at MIT. One notable
                project was to formalize and implement C-IDEF, an automated version IDEF, a modeling language developed
                by the United States Air Force in the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) project.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1985</p> - Leaves HOS.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="year">1986</p> - founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
                The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated
                environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of Development Before The Fact for systems design
                and software development.
